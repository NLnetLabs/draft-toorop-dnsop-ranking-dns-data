                    Ranking Domain Name System data
                 draft-toorop-dnsop-ranking-dns-data-01

Abstract

   This document extends the list ranking the trustworthiness of domain
   name system (DNS) data (see Section 5.4.1 of [RFC2181]).  The list is
   extended with entries for root server names and addresses built-in
   resolvers, and provided via a root hints file with the lowest
   trustworthiness, as wel as an entry for data which is verifiable
   DNSSEC secure with the highest trustworthiness.  This document
   furthermore assigns ranked values to the positions of the list for
   easier reference and comparison of trustworthiness of DNS data.

1.  Introduction

   This draft's intention is currently just to start re-evaluation and
   re-thinking of [RFC2181], Section 5.4.1 about ranking trustworthiness
   of DNS data.

2.  Trustworthiness values

   +=======+===========================================================+
   | Value | Data                                                      |
   +=======+===========================================================+
   | AAA   | Data from a primary zone file other than                  |
   |       | occluded data, and all data that is verifiable            |
   |       | DNSSEC secure regardless off where it came from           |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | AA    | Data from a zone transfer other than occluded             |

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.

4.  Security Considerations

   The process of replacing RRsets in a resolvers cache with the RRsets
   with a higher trustworthiness ranking, either passively or pro-
   actively by explicit querying, is crucial to the security of the DNS.

5.  Normative References

              Specification", RFC 2181, DOI 10.17487/RFC2181, July 1997,
